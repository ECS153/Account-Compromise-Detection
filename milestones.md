> Milestone 1
> 12 May 2020

**Summary:**
We had a meeting on 8 May 2020 to discuss the project goals, details, and technologies/API we would require. We identified an initial prototype, and what we plan on implementing for subsequent versions (as we plan on continuing to develop this project over the summer). The extensive meeting notes and design details are found here:

*To clarify our expected workflow and progress tracking*:
The majority of our work will be done at the IET Security Operations Center off-campus, as we must be on the office network to test our scripts with real data. Because of this, most of our progress will be as a group since we meet in person, rather than having multiple individual reports.

**Group Progress:**
(1) what you did last week:
 - Identified the specific technologies/API we will require for collecting data relevant to our project (outlined in meeting-notes linked above)
 - Identified expected project goals and overall project design
 - Set up Elastic Stack and MaxMind DB APIs to be ready to implement

(2) what you plan to do this week:
 - Finish building Microsoft Graphs API tool
 - Upload the code to our project Github

(3) anything that you’re stuck on:
 - nothing currently
